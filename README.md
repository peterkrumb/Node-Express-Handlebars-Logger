# Node-Express-Handlebars-Logger

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to create a playlist app that lets you add songs into a list, then click listen to transfer them over into the listened category.

## MVC Layout
This assignment used the MVC layout, so we had to use object relational mapping or ORM as well as a controller, model, and handlebars to render the pages. These three work in tandem to communicate with the database and run get and post requests to get info. The ORM was a preconstructed js code that lets you easily repeat the same function several times just reusing the same code. The controller or routes was the intermediary between the database and html page, and the handlebars are in place of the index.html in order to have cleaner, less repetitive code. The song.js contained the simple handling of front end on-click events.
